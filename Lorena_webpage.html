  <h2> Plot:</h2>

  <h3>Vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon Salvatore, battle for the affection of selfless teenager, Elena Gilbert. Stefan is the good and kind hearted brother that feeds on animal blood to keep from killing anybody, and Damon is the selfish and dangerous older brother that feeds on human blood carelessly. Elena is brought into the supernatrual world that she was hidden from as a girl, and surrounds herself with a circle of human AND supernatrual friends, ready to fight the hunters and enemies that wait for them in the shadows.</h3>
